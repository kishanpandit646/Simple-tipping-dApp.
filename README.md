## Project Title
**Simple Tipping dApp**

## Project Description
The Simple Tipping dApp is a decentralized application that allows users to send tips to other users using Ethereum. The contract provides a simple mechanism for users to tip others by transferring Ether, and allows users to withdraw their accumulated tips. The contract is designed to be easy to use and can be deployed on any Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Simple Tipping dApp is to create a straightforward and efficient method for users to send and receive tips in a decentralized environment. This platform empowers users to directly transfer value to others without relying on intermediaries, using the security and transparency of the blockchain.

## Future Scope
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Support for other cryptocurrencies or tokenized tips could be added in the future to extend functionality.
- **User Profiles**: Adding user profiles where users can track their tipping history and earnings.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Build a mobile application to allow users to interact with the contract more easily.
- **Smart Contracts for Custom Tips**: Introduce features such as setting recurring tips or rewarding specific content creators.

## Key Features
- **Send Tips**: Users can send Ether to other users through the `sendTip` function, allowing for peer-to-peer tipping.
- **Withdraw Tips**: Users can withdraw the tips they have received using the `withdrawTips` function, transferring the balance to their wallet.
- **Owner Withdrawals**: The contract owner can withdraw any remaining funds in the contract using the `withdrawContractBalance` function.
- **Balance Tracking**: Users can check their balance and the contract's balance using the `getUserBalance` and `getContractBalance` functions.
- **Event Notification**: Every time a tip is sent, the contract emits a `TipReceived` event to notify listeners about the transaction.
